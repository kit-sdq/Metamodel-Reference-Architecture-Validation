This repository is currently empty.
Its future content can currently be found at:
* https://svnserver.informatik.kit.edu/i43/svn/palladio/misha.strittmatter/ResearchProjects/MetamodelReferenceStructure

There is currently work ongoing.
Afterward, the repository needs to be restructured and will be migrated at the same time.
The purpose of this repository (in its current empty state) is to serve as a location that can be referenced by the companion tech report of the metamodel reference architecture TSE paper.
